
Project on Software Engineering Course, CVUT 

##Specifications: 

- You work in teams of 3-5 people. The supervisor makes the final decision about the team structure.
- Work within the term is divided into 3 iterations.
- At the end of each iteration, the team presents the results and submit the required documentation.
- The project must solve a non-trivial business problem and plan to develop a complex information system.
- The system must be designed using object-oriented approach and at least 2-layered architecture.


##Content of the iterations

- **1st iteration**
mainly analysis and inception of design
it is strongly recommended to start experimenting with the project technologies and frameworks early on
documentation
Analysis of business processes
Most important business-oriented processes in the domain that should be supported and improved by the system
UML Activity diagrams + textual description of the processes
Requirements analysis
Requirements catalogue - a list of functional and non-functional requirements with descriptions
Use case model
List of actors and their description
UML Use Case diagrams - actors, use cases, boundary
Description of all use cases
Detailed description of the most crucial use cases
At least the same number as the number of team members
Non-trivial use cases, the main functions to achieve the business goals
Scenarios - main scenario, alternative scenarios
Mapping of the use cases onto the requirements
Domain model
UML Class diagram(s) - classes with attributes, associations with names and cardinalities
Description of the domain entities (classes), their attributes and relations
UML State diagram(s) for specific entities with important states
Overview of the crucial UCs
A separate page linked from the home page.
Summary of the most crucial business use cases that will be designed and implemented in the next iterations.
Each UC with a short description and scenario.

- **2nd iteration**
mainly design, finishing analysis, inception of implementation
finalization of the analysis based on design decisions
design decisions, specification of architecture and technologies
initiation of implementation, preparation of environment, hello world of chosen technologies
documentation:
Description of chosen technologies and frameworks
User interface
Data persistence
Business logic, Dependency Injection, etc.
Software architecture
UML Component diagram - components, dependencies, interfaces
Description of basic system components / layers, principle of their isolation (interfaces) - not necessary to define exact interfaces
Design model
UML Class diagrams - classes, attributes, methods, directed associations, role names, cardinalities
Description of the classes
Based on chosen architecture, technologies and domain model
Focused on realization of the crucial use cases - definition of classes required to realize them
Logically organized in packages according to the chosen architecture
Contents
Data objects - classes to hold the data, inspired by the domain model, extended with the data types, associations' orientation, role names
Implementation classes - classes providing the behaviour - data persistence, business logic, validations, etc.
UI classes - classes of the user interface, providing the data to user and collecting the input
Assignment of responsibilities - added methods of the business logic and other processes to adequate classes
Realization of Use Cases
UML Sequence diagrams or UML Communication diagrams + Descriptions
Realization of the crucial use cases by the system classes
Communication of the instances of the classes from the design model
Database model
UML Class diagram
Structure of the system database
Description of database tables, primary and foreign keys, data types, realization of many-to-many relations
Proof-of-Concept prototype
A prototype to prove the ability to show a record from the database on the UI using the chosen technologies and frameworks
